# Hey there! I'm R0scat

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I'm a first year compsci student and general curious mind who loves learning new stuff and occasionally pushing random commits at 2 AM. 🛠️💡

##  What I’m working on

- Dungeons and Dragons inspired Character Builder (hopefully in the future with a decent GUI I'm planning on actually drawing!)
- Neverending college projects
- Small projects for friends (valentine website and arduino project)  

##  What I like

- Coding in C++, Python and Javascript 
- Doodling with design & UI/UX
- Exploring open-source projects
- Gaming and chill playlists while I code
